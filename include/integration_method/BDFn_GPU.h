 * This file declares a class which implement six BDF (Backward Differentiation Formulas) integration methods (from 
 * first order to sixth order BDF integration method) in GPU (this class is stored in CPU memory and controles the
 * reservation and freeing of GPU auxiliar memory). This method implements a progressive implementation of the
 * higher order integration method using the lower order integration mehtod (BDF1->BDF2->...->BDF6).All integration
 * methods in GPU are fixed step due to the parallel architecture of this one.
