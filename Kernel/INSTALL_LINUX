Basic Installation on Ubuntu
============================

These are generic installation instructions to compile and use EDLUT on Ubuntu machines. However, the procedure should be quite similar if you are using any other Linux distribution.

Dependencies
============

Dependencies required to compile EDLUT are rather simple.
- C++ compiler.
- Cmake installation tools.
- Python 2.X or 3.X versions to run simulations from Python (optional).
- BOOST Python library (libboost-python-dev) if Python used (optional).
- Cython for faster Python binding (optional).
- OpenMP for shared-memory parallel simulations (optional).
- CUDA for GPU-powered faster simulations (optional).

1. In Ubuntu you can install these dependencies by typing in your command-line terminal:

----->>>>>> sudo apt install build-essential cmake libboost-python-dev
----->>>>>> pip install Cython

Building EDLUT simulator
========================

First, you need to download EDLUT source code. You could download it as a .zip file or clone it from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/EduardoRosLab/edlut_private).

For the starting point, we assume that you have been able to clone the EDLUT source code from the repository, so a folder called edlut_private has been created with all the source code of the simulator in the directory <download_directory>. Please, note that if you have downloaded an specific branch as a .zip file, you might get the code downloaded in different folder (e.g. EDLUT_python branch might get extracted to the edlut_private-EDLUT_python directory). In that case, we recommend to rename the folder to edlut_private.

Then you will need to create a folder (you can choose the name that you prefer, but it has to be used every time that <temp_directory> is indicated) where all the building temporary folders will be stored:

----->>>>>> mkdir <temp_directory>
----->>>>>> cd <temp_directory>


Now it is time to configure the building project. We assume that we want to install EDLUT in the folder called <install_directory> and the source code has been extracted to <download_directory>/edlut_private folder:

----->>>>>> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<install_directory> <download_directory>/edlut_private/Kernel 

Note: Be sure that you specify <install_directory> as an absolute path (/folderA/folderB/folderC/.....) instead of a relative path (../folderA/folderB/.....).

This tool will check that all the dependencies are correctly installed and set up in your systems, so it is critical that you check there exist no errors in this step. In particular, you need to check the following lines:
* The C++ compiler to be used in the line: -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 7.5.0
* The Python version to be used. If any Python version is found in your system, the default one will be used as the reference to compile EDLUT: -- Found PythonInterp: /usr/bin/python (found version "2.7.17").
* The OpenMP version to be used: -- Found OpenMP: TRUE (found version "4.5").
* The CUDA version to be used.
* The BOOST library version: -- Boost version: 1.65.1.

Please, note that different versions of each package can be found in your system. However, it does not necessarily represent an issue, as other versions should be compatible too.

Other versions or building options can be chosen with the following definitions:
* -Dwith-cuda: Request compilation with CUDA parallelization. Optionally give directory with CUDA installation (Default=OFF).
* -Dwith-openmp: Enable OpenMP multithreading. Optional: set OMP flag (Default=ON).
* -Dwith-python: Enable Python binding. Optional: set Python version (2 or 3) (Default=ON).
* -Dwith-optimize: Enable user defined optimizations (Default=ON, when ON, defaults to '-O3').
* -Dwith-debug: Enable user defined debug flags. (Default=OFF, when ON, defaults to '-g').
* -Dwith-profiling: Enable user defined profiling flags (default OFF, when ON).
* -Dwith-doc: Enable class documentation generation (default OFF, when ON).
* -Dwith-permissive: Compile in permissive mode (default ON).

Compiling EDLUT simulator. Just run the following command and check that no errors are shown during this process (many Warnings could happen but errors should not be allowed):

----->>>>>> make

Installing EDLUT simulator. Run the following command:

----->>>>>> make install

If everything happens as expected, after this step, EDLUT should be installed in <install_directory> (the one used during the cmake command). In particular, you should check that the following files exist:
* <install_directory>/bin/edlutkernel
* <install_directory>/bin/vars.sh
* <install_directory>/lib/libedlut.a
* <install_directory>/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/pyedlut/simulationwrapper.so only if Python binding was selected (where pythonX.Y is the Python version installed in your system and selected during the configuration process).

Testing EDLUT installation
==========================

Optional: In order to test EDLUT installation your computer needs numpy and motplotlib Python libraries correctly configured in your favorite Python environment. Once these libraries are installed, type the following commands:

----->>>>>>  source <install_directory>/bin/vars.sh
----->>>>>>  cd <download_directory>/edlut_private/Kernel/utils
----->>>>>>  python python_test.py

Once the test simulation is finished you should obtain a raster plot of the spikes emitted by the different neurons in the simulation.


Running EDLUT simulations from command line
===========================================

In principle, EDLUT simulations could be run by just calling EDLUT executable file with the following commands:

----->>>>>> cd <install_directory>/bin
----->>>>>> ./edlutkernel -time 10 -nf <network_filename> -wf <weights_filename>

If the executable runs, EDLUT is correctly installed (even if it launches some errors about the network and weight files.


Setting EDLUT for your Ubuntu environment
=========================================

If you want EDLUT to be part of your Ubuntu PATH environment variables (just to find EDLUT executable from wherever you are), you just need to type this every time you start your command line:

----->>>>>> source <install_directory>/bin/vars.sh

If you want EDLUT to be added for every time you launch a command line terminal you just need to add the previous command at the end of your $HOME/.profile file and restart your session.


Using EDLUT from Python
=======================

Once you have sourced vars.sh file from your installation folder, EDLUT should also be available as a library for your Python installation (if it has been set during the configuration process). In particular, you could access to EDLUT-from-Python API by just typing the following line in your Python command line:

----->>>>>> import pyedlut

Please, be sure that your Python version is the same one as it was configured during the installation process.

If you want to know more about the Python/EDLUT interface you can have a look to the *.py examples in the <download_directory>/Kernel/utils folder of the EDLUT source code.


Using EDLUT from a virtual environment
======================================

Virtual environments are a good approach to keep reasonably isolated Python environments with specific libraries. They include a Python interpreter as well as specific versions of the required Python libraries. If you want to know more about how to set your virtual environments and use them to run Jupyter notebooks, please, check the following link: https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/

Once created the virtual environment, you can add your EDLUT installation to that environment by just creating a new text file called edlut.pth in the <virtual_env_path>/lib64/pythonX.X/site-packages folder with the following text:

<install_directory>/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages

where pythonX.Y represents the Python version of your virtual environment, and it should match the python version set to compile EDLUT.
